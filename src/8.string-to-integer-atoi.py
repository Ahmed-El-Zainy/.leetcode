#
# Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit
# signed integer.
# 
# The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:
# 
# 
# Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (" ").
# Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or
# '+', assuming positivity if neither present.
# Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit
# character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits
# were read, then the result is 0.
# Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-2^31,
# 2^31 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically,
# integers less than -2^31 should be rounded to -2^31, and integers greater
# than 2^31 - 1 should be rounded to 2^31 - 1.
# 
# 
# Return the integer as the final result.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "42"
# 
# Output: 42
# 
# Explanation:
# 
# 
# The underlined characters are what is read in and the caret is the current
# reader position.
# Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
# ⁠        ^
# Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
# ⁠        ^
# Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)
# ⁠          ^
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: s = " -042"
# 
# Output: -42
# 
# Explanation:
# 
# 
# Step 1: "   -042" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
# ⁠           ^
# Step 2: "   -042" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
# ⁠            ^
# Step 3: "   -042" ("042" is read in, leading zeros ignored in the result)
# ⁠              ^
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "1337c0d3"
# 
# Output: 1337
# 
# Explanation:
# 
# 
# Step 1: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is no leading
# whitespace)
# ⁠        ^
# Step 2: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor
# '+')
# ⁠        ^
# Step 3: "1337c0d3" ("1337" is read in; reading stops because the next
# character is a non-digit)
# ⁠            ^
# 
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "0-1"
# 
# Output: 0
# 
# Explanation:
# 
# 
# Step 1: "0-1" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
# ⁠        ^
# Step 2: "0-1" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
# ⁠        ^
# Step 3: "0-1" ("0" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a
# non-digit)
# ⁠         ^
# 
# 
# 
# Example 5:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "words and 987"
# 
# Output: 0
# 
# Explanation:
# 
# Reading stops at the first non-digit character 'w'.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 0 <= s.length <= 200
# s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (0-9), ' ',
# '+', '-', and '.'.
