# Testcase Example:  '2'
#
# You are given an integer n.
# 
# A number is called special if:
# 
# 
# It is a palindrome.
# Every digit k in the number appears exactly k times.
# 
# 
# Return the smallest special number strictly greater than n.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 2
# 
# Output: 22
# 
# Explanation:
# 
# 22 is the smallest special number greater than 2, as it is a palindrome and
# the digit 2 appears exactly 2 times.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 33
# 
# Output: 212
# 
# Explanation:
# 
# 212 is the smallest special number greater than 33, as it is a palindrome and
# the digits 1 and 2 appear exactly 1 and 2 times respectively.
